        <p>As a child, Shinra awakened the ability of a Third Generation and gained the <br>
             ability to ignite, control, and utilize flames from his feet. While doing so, he leaves <br> 
             ashes on the floor in the shape of feet, which is known as the "Devil's Footprints"</p>
 
        <p>Using Shinra's ability he is able to severe limbs or destroy infernals core with a simple kick. <br>
            With his kicks, he can cause an explosion on contact to lift an object as heavy as a car high into the air. <br>
            With his ignited feet, he can change the trajectory of his kicks in mid-air, allowing him to rush in with a flurry of kicks one after another repeatedly. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Shinra was taught by Captain Benimaru how to utilize hand signs/seals in order to redirect <br> 
            and concentrate the energy in his body. This allows him to manipulate characteristics of <br>
            the flames he produces from his Ignition Ability.
        </p>

        <li>Tora Hishigi - A hand sign/seal used for directing focus and power to his feet; this allows <br>
            Shinra to use Rapid, which increases the thrust of his flames, giving him an exponential boost in speed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Corna - When Shinra uses this hand seal his flames manifest in an explosive nature, allowing him to attack with a lot more force.</li>

        <p>Having the Adolla Burst, Shinra can be temporarily empowered with the Adolla Grace through forcing an Adolla Link <br>
            to a person who originates from Adolla, or someone graced.</p>
        
        <p>Under Grace, Shinra can enter a state of light speed, causing his body to split into subatomic particles in the process. <br>
             The particles then surpass the speed of light, allowing them to go a few seconds back in time <br>
              to the point before Shinra's body broke apart.</p> 
        <p>Doing so enables him to circumvent the laws of physics and allow him to travel at relativistic speeds <br>
             without ending up dead. Under such state, Shinra could see images of Tempe's past <br>
             in his head, enter Sho's Severed Universe, and accumulate enough strength to <br>
              defeat the Demon Infernal. The connection with his Adolla Burst is strengthened according to the intensity of his desire.</p>
